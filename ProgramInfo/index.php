                <p class="bannerp">The WSU Computer Science department offers two different types of computer science majors. There is a Computer Science option and Applied Computer Science option which allows students to take more classes in one of three areas. Both major options include the same core computer science courses.</p>

                    <p>WSU offers the Path to Purple program for Rochester Community and Technical College (RCTC) students. Our students can take advantage of the Path to Purple program in a variety of ways:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students can enroll at RCTC as part of the Path to Purple/2+2 program to earn an associate's degree, then move on to complete a bachelor's degree in selected academic programs with WSU-Rochester on the Rochester campus or WSU on the Winona campus.</li>
                    <li>Students can initially enroll in RCTC and then make an independent decision as to when they want to apply for admission to WSU.</li>
                    <li>Students who do not initially qualify for admission to WSU can enroll in RCTC to gain sufficient academic standing to qualify them for acceptance with transfer student status at WSU.</li>
                </ul>
