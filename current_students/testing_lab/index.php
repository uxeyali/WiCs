			<h2 class="orange">About the Lab</h2>
              <p>WSU Computer Science students staff the Software Testing and Development Lab
       and work to provide services to local and regional businesses and industries.
       These services include testing, development, along with other computer and
       networking related technical services. WSU Computer Science students
       provide these services under the direction and supervision of 
       Computer Science faculty and staff.</p><br>
       <p>Although any WSU student can work at the Software Testing Lab,
       Computer Science students are typically given preference. Student
       work hours vary during the school year and during breaks. During 
       academic terms students may work 10 to 15 hours per week. 
       During breaks or the Summer they work 20 to 40 hours per week.</p>

    <p>Students may apply for Testing Lab positions at anytime,
           however students are accepted to the lab typically between
           the beginning of a term and midterm. Applications are kept      
       for the next acceptance cycle, but students should reapply
       each term if they are not immediately selected. Application forms are available in the CS department office.
       Applications should be submitted to Dr. Cichanowski or Sue McDonnell.
