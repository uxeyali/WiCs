                <br>
				<p>Winona State University's computer science practicum provides Computer Science majors with experience in a non-academic setting. It is intended to serve as an introduction to an application environment as well as to solidify many of the concepts learned in the classroom. For these reasons, it is to be taken only by students who are nearing the end of their program of study and who have little or no previous work experience. For those students who are currently employed, the practicum must provide them with work experience which is substantially different from any previous or current work experience. The class, CS 491, is offered for 6 semester credits, only 3 of these credits can be applied to a computer science major, and the student receives a P or N grade. </p>
                <p>If you are interested in a practicum, read the requirements before completing the Student Information Form.</p>

		<h3 class="purple"> Eligibility Requirements</h3>
          
			<p>Students who are considering a practicum should apply by
			completing the "CS 491 Student Information" form. They should
			return it, along with a copy of their student transcript, 
			to the coordinator at least one term before they intend to 
			register for the practicum. To be eligible, students must:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Be a declared CS or CIS major and be admitted in the respective program.</li>
				<li>Have junior or senior status</li>
				<li>Have completed the following courses: CS 341, CS 351, CS 410, [Stat 210 or Math 165], 
				CS 385 or CS 405(old CS 376)], [CS 470 or CS 371(old CS 417)], and [CS 412 or CS 485]. 
				All prerequisites to these courses must be completed with a C grade or better.  
				At least 5 computer science courses must be completed through WSU. A student who
				has failed one or more courses as a result of cheating, according to department 
				records, is not eligible for CS 491.</li>
				<li>Provide the names of two WSU computer science professors, 
				from whom they have taken core or option courses, who have agreed to serve as references.</li>
				<li>Have been granted no more than 3 semester hours of equivalency 
				credit for previous work experience in computer science.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>A CS 491 Student Information form can be obtained by contacting
			the coordinator or downloading and printing one.</p>

			<p>After receiving formal approval of their application,
			the student will be given a "Practicum Proposal" form and
			may begin the process of locating a practicum site. 
			Locating a site is the responsibility of the student; 
			however, the coordinator may suggest several possible 
			companies. To secure a site, you are expected to apply to
                companies as with a normal job search.</p>
        
			<p>If an offer is made, you must make the supervisor aware that you expect it to 
			be for academic credit, that they must allow an onsite visit by
			the coordinator, and they must review your written practicum report 
			at the end. If, for any reason, the company does not allow an onsite
			visit or does not allow you to release a report, the proposal will not be approved.</p>

		  <h3 class="purple">  Submitting a Practicum Proposal</h3>
          
			<p>After an approved student has located a practicum site,
			he/she should complete the Practicum Proposal form and 
			return it to the coordinator at least 6 weeks before 
			they intend to register for the practicum. The purpose 
			of this form is to determine if the site and tasks 
			performed will be suitable for practicum credit. The
			information needed for this will include:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>The term in which the student plans to register for the practicum.</li>
				<li>An estimate of the time required to complete the proposed tasks, in hours.</li>
				<li>Beginning and ending dates of the practicum.</li>
				<li>The name, address, and phone number of the supervisor.</li>
				<li>An outline of the tasks to be performed.</li>
			</ol><br>
			
			<p>To be approved, a minimum of 200 hours is required on site, 
			the tasks performed must be related to the concepts introduced
			in the student's computer science course work, and the proposed
			practicum must be substantially different from any previous or 
			current work experience. Final approval rests with the practicum 
			coordinator. The student must have formal approval from the 
			coordinator before he/she can register for the class and before 
                any work is performed.</p>

						  <h3 class="purple">Completing the Practicum</h3>
         
			<p>In addition to the tasks designated by the company, 
			to complete the practicum, the student is required to provide the following:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>A 3-4 page, typed, report by the student which summarizes the student's
				experience. This report must be submitted to the student's supervisor for approval.</li>
				<li>A report from the student's supervisor, on company stationery,
				confirming the accuracy of the student's report and verifying that 
				the student has not disclosed any confidential information. Both 
				reports must be sent directly from the supervisor to the coordinator
				and are due on the last class day of the term in which the student 
				has registered for the practicum. The student is responsible for 
				supplying the necessary mailing materials.</li>
				<li>An oral report describing the student's practicum experience.
				This report, up to 50 minutes in length, will be given on campus 
				and be open to interested faculty and students.</li>
				<li>A final exit interview with the practicum coordinator.</li>
