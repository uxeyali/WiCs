                <p> We are a supportive network to help women join and enjoy the culture of computer science and its project. Every week, we meet to help, inspire, and challenge each other. Or just to chat and make new friends because it's important to have someone who understands the challenges women in computer science faces everyday.</p>

                    <p>Computer science majors can choose from two options: Computer Science and Applied Computer Science. Both options require a common core set of courses designed to give students a fundamental understanding of both theoretical and applied computer science.

                        In addition to the programs for the Computer Science Major, the department offers a Computer Science Minor and a Computer Technology Minor.
